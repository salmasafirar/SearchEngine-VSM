# Simple Search Engine Using Vector Space Model in Python
A simple search engine application made using the Vector Space Model (VSM) method gives the
results of the degree of similarity and the percentage of similarity between the comparison document
or query with the test document. The process of this method, first is to calculate word weights by
pre-processing using Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), then calculating the
dot product between the comparison document and each test document and the dot product document
with the document itself. Then to calculate the angle using cosine similarity to get the value of the
degree of similarity between the comparison document and each test document. The test was carried
out using 20 test documents and 1 comparison document from several different sources. The test
results show that the application can operate the VSM method well, and in the testing process, the
VSM method is not affected by the length of the document and is not affected by word order.
